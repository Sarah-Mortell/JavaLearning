Recipe for using git:

Step 1: Clone the repo -

"git clone *INSERT REPO URL*"

This will clone your repo



Step 2: Adding files to repo -

Locate your repo folder on your computer and drag any FILES you wish to commit to GIT into this folder.
Once the files have been added use the following command:

"git add *" - This will add NEW files or updated previously committed files to the repo.

If you want to add an individual file to a repo you need to specify its name.

For example - If we want to add this file to the repo and not any other files were working on we must use the following command: 


"git add instructions.txt"


Step 3: Pushing our code

In order to push our code we must first give it a commit message
We do this by using the following command:

git commit -m "MESSAGE GOES HERE"

Once we add our commit, we then push!

git push
