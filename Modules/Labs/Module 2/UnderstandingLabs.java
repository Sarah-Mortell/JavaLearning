    Why Are Scanners Used in Java?
        Allow computer to receive user input
        Scanner input = new Scanner (System.in);
        Must import java.util.scanner; (This allows the scanner to be used by computer)
        ; = tells the compiler where an instruction ends
     To enter numbers into scanner:
        System.out.print("Enter Numbers:");
        num1 = input. nextInt(); // takes in next user input that's an integer


     Double Quotations:
        Any text or numbers entered within System.out.println("x"); will be printed as text


     Formatted Data:
        Process of inserting a custom string or variable to text
        System.out.printf("The Result is %d\n", the result);

     %d :
        Means that an int value is expected at that position in the string
            e.g: "%d\n" - when the n comes after %d it means new line
                                    OR
                 "%d is the best\n"
